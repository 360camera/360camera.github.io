            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a high school student who's interested in computer science. 
                Programming is my main hobby outside of school.
                My most frequented video games are Rocket League, Minecraft, and Team Fortress 2 (and occasionally I'll binge other games for a few weeks).
                I chose the name FourFiftyOne from the HTTP status code 451 (Unavailable for Legal Reasons).
                I generated my profile picture using PIL/Pillow - the source code is available on my GitHub.
            </p>
            <h3>About This Site</h3>
            <p>
                I created this site as a side project to relearn CSS and HTML as well as to get a deeper understanding of web servers.
                Its original purpose was just going to be a landing page for my Rocket League API, but midway through 
                creating it I decided it would be nice to have a clean homepage I could build off of in the future.
                After finishing the homepage I decided to host it on GitHub Sites, so the API isn't included anymore.
            </p>
            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>
                I haven't setup a good and anonymous way to contact me yet - this isn't my top priority at the moment as I am busy with other things.
